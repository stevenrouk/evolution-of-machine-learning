code review feedback

- Need to include Docstrings for functions
- Could use more classes
    - for example, a "Topic" class or something -- pass in year and n_components
    - could have a data cleaner class, modeling class, etc.
- writing tests
    - can write tests to test pieces of the functionality (e.g. test that an output file
      exists after the code executes)
- have a "verbose" option that does a more full-fledged printing process, etc.
