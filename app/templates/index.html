    <h3>Project overview</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>It's no overstatement to say that machine learning—and data science more broadly—is revolutionizing our
          society. The purpose of this project was to use <b>unsupervised learning</b> techniques (such as <b>topic
            modeling</b>, <b>NMF</b>, and others) to analyze the evolution of the field of machine learning over the
          last 20 years, including an inquiry into various subfields of machine learning and how those have risen and
          fallen with time.</p>
        <p>In the menu of this website, you'll find the primary sections of analysis:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b><a href="{{ url_for('how_topics_are_defined') }}">How Topics Are Defined</a></b>—In addition to an
            explanation of what a "topic" is (hint: one way to think about it is as a subfield of machine learning), the
            first tab shows the results of topic modeling on the arXiv.org machine learning research paper descriptions.
            You can see which words are associated with which topics, and the title I decided to give each topic.</li>
          <li><b><a href="{{ url_for('change_over_time') }}">Change Over Time</a></b>—The graphs on this page show how
            prevalent each topic has been over the last 20 years. One of the main results from this page is the rise of
            neural networks and deep learning over the last 5 years.</li>
          <li><b><a href="{{ url_for('analysis_by_year') }}">Analysis by Year</a></b>—On this page, you can conduct your
            own analysis by looking at varying numbers of topics for different years. I think it's interesting to see
            which topics existed in the early 2000s (e.g. AIXI) that don't show up in topics for modern years.</li>
          <li><b><a href="{{ url_for('papers') }}">All Papers</a></b>—If you want to browse all of the machine learning
            research papers from arXiv.org, this page lets you do that.</li>
          <li><b><a href="{{ url_for('get_random_paper') }}">Random ML Paper</a></b>—Or, if you'd prefer to randomly
            sample from the repository, you can jump to a random paper. For practitioners, this is an excellent way of
            expanding your horizons.</li>
          <li><b><a href="{{ url_for('search') }}">Search</a></b>—Finally, I've provided two methods of search
            functionality to help you find papers.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>But before we dive any deeper into the details and results of the project, what <em>is</em> machine learning?
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>What is machine learning?</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-7">
        <p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, "Machine
          learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models
          that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns
          and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence."</p>
        <p>But perhaps a better way to start this discussion is to talk about what machine learning has <em>done</em> in
          recent years.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>A brief history</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-7">
        <p>Let's walk through a very short history of some defining moments in machine learning from recent(ish) years.
          <em>(For a bit of context, a few non-machine learning accomplishments have been listed in italicized
            parentheticals.)</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>(The first web browser was made available to the public in 1991.)</em></li>
          <li>Deep Blue (by IBM) beat Garry Kasparov in chess in 1997.</li>
          <li><em>(Google was founded in 1998.)</em></li>
          <li><em>(The first iPhone was released in 2007.)</em></li>
          <li>Watson (once again by IBM) beat Jeopardy champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings in 2011.</li>
          <li>AlphaGo (by Google/DeepMind) beat a 9-dan professional Go player in 2016.</li>
          <li>The first self-driving car completed the first DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005. By the end of 2016, Google's
            fleet of self-driving cars had completed over 2,000,000 autonomous miles.</li>
          <li>In 2018, an NLP AI by Alibaba outperformed Stanford students on a reading and comprehension test, and
            Google releases "Duplex", an AI assistant with an incredibly human-like voice that can make reservations for
            you.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Machine learning in your life</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-7">
        <p>Although self-driving cars and other futuristic technologies have been in the news much more over the last
          few years, we don't interact with any of those (yet). However, there are countless examples of ways we
          <em>do</em> interact with machine learning on a daily basis.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Every time you deposit a check, there is character recognition technology at work reading the check amount
            and other numbers and letters on the check. That's machine learning at work.</li>
          <li>Whenever you use Google to search for something, there's a whole suite of machine learning algorithms at
            work trying to make sure you get the most useful results for <em>you</em>, independent of what other people
            might find helpful.</li>
          <li>Digital advertisers are some of the biggest users of machine learning, using your personal data and
            browsing history to put relevant ads in front of you all over the web.</li>
          <li>Anytime you use media services like Netflix or Spotify, or e-commerce platforms like Amazon, machine
            learning is being used to show you recommendations that they think you'll like.</li>
          <li>Increasingly, machine learning might be used at some point in processing your insurance claims or in
            diagnosing medical conditions.</li>
          <li>And finally, if you use Google Translate (machine learning assisted translation), Snapchat (computer
            vision), Facebook (image recognition), PayPal (fraud detection), or countless other online services, you're
            using machine learning.</li>
          <li><em>(And we haven't even discussed at all how the government is using machine learning.)</em></li>
        </ul>

    <h3>A meteoric rise</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-7">
        <p>Machine learning has exploded in recent years, in large part due to breakthroughs made possible by modern
          computing power, and also because of success in commercial applications of machine learning tools and
          approaches. This success and interest can be seen in the exponential growth of machine learning papers
          published on the open paper repository site <a href="https://arXiv.org">arXiv.org</a>, which was the
          datasource for the Evolution of Machine Learning project.</p>

    <h2>Data & Research Question</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-7">
        <p>There are 1.6 million research papers hosted on <a href="https://www.arxiv.org">arXiv.org</a>, around 50,000
          of which are categorized as machine learning papers. arXiv generously makes the paper metadata freely
          available through their open API, which means that it was fairly easy to pull paper descriptions, authors,
          etc. for all of the machine learning papers (and indeed, all of the papers).</p>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to see if I could use natural language processing techniques on the machine
          learning paper descriptions to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Identify subfields of machine learning; and,</li>
          <li>See how those subfields of machine learning have evolved over time.</li>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-7">
        <p>Although there are many techniques that can be used to analyze text data, and a subset of those techniques
          that can be used to cluster text data into various groups, I settled on <b>non-negative matrix factorization
            (NMF)</b> as my technique of choice, paired with featurizing the data into a term-frequency
          document-inverse-frequency (tf-idf) matrix.</p>
        <p>After experimenting with many different preprocessing steps, I decided to have a very simple process of
          removing punctuation, removing stopwords using the standard nltk corpus, and using unigrams (bag of words) to
          create a tf-idf matrix.</p>

    <h3>Number of Topics</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-7">
        <p>For an introduction to topic modeling using NMF, see here: <a
            href="https://mlexplained.com/2017/12/28/a-practical-introduction-to-nmf-nonnegative-matrix-factorization/"
            target="_blank">A Practical Introduction to NMF</a>.</p>
        <p>After trying many different numbers of topics, I decided to use 10 topics for the primary analysis because it
          gave detailed results while still being a reasonable number of manually sift through.</p>
        <p>I thought that 20 topics also yielding very interesting results, with the added benefit that there were
          additional clearly-defined subfields of machine learning that didn't come out of the 10-topic analysis. To see
          an approximation of these topics for the full corpus, you can select 20 topics and the year 2019 or 2018 on
          the <a href="/analysis-by-year?year=2019&num_topics=20">Analysis by Year</a> page. <em>(In the future I may
            add the functionality to look at varying numbers of topics for the full corpus.)</em></p>
        <p>As one important note: whenever you see "loadings", such as "topics loadings", it simply means how much that
          document (or that word) relates to that topic. So the word "neural" will load heavily onto the neural network
          topic, and a research paper about neural networks will also load heavily onto that topic.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-7">
        <p>Here is where I'll let you loose to investigate the rest of the findings yourself!</p>
        <p>You'll find the specific words that make up each topic on the <b>How Topics Are Defined</b> page. You can see
          how
          these topics have changed over time (make sure to look at the Neural Nets / Deep Learning topic) on the
          <b>Change Over Time</b> page. And, make sure to use the <b>Search</b> for research papers that you're
          interested in and see what topics were assigned to that paper.</p>
        <p>I hope you find this analysis and tool useful!</p>
